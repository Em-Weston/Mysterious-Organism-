## General info
This project has been created via codecadamy. Check out the link below.
The project uses Javascript objects to simulate DNA of a mysterious organism. The mysterious organism is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates makes the mysterious organism an interesting specimen to study. However, locating the mysterious organism is difficult and expensive. This project creates objects that simulate the DNA of a mysterious organism for a research team to study.

## Project Status
Still in progress. Once complete, I will consider fututer updates and changes. 
* Create 30 instances of m.o. that can survive in their natural environment. Store these instances in an array for your team to study later.
	I have created a function that stores m.o. DNA that can survive. I need to change it, so it stores 30 instances at a time. 
	Ideally, also checking the length and returning the value, so I know it's 30.
