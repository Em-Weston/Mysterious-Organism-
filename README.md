## General info
This project has been created via codecadamy. Check out the link below.
The project uses Javascript objects to simulate DNA of a mysterious organism. The mysterious organism is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates makes the mysterious organism an interesting specimen to study. However, locating the mysterious organism is difficult and expensive. This project creates objects that simulate the DNA of a mysterious organism for a research team to study.
